## 3. Problem Statement :
### To analyse the performance of recommendation systems when applied on distinctively segmented customer base of an E-commerce company.
Needless to say, Recommendation Systems are re-shaping the E-commerce industry worldwide in a way that has made them a serious business tool now-a-days. Evidently, 35% of Amazon’s revenue is generated by its recommendation system. But no recommendation system is 100% accurate. In fact, any recommendation system is primarily based on the theory of probability that the user might purchase the item given his purchase history/ search history/ interest etc. So, our primary objective is to determine the performance of recommendation systems. 
But this is just the first part of the problem. For the next part, we know that E-commerce companies divide/categorize their customers based on some factors to target the different segments strategically and efficiently. Hoping, segmentation will yield better recommendations when the users are divided based on their preference, we'll make use of clustering techniques upon the customers and apply the recommendation systems on individual clusters thereby simulateneously trying to analyze the results.

1. Initially, Recommendation System will be tested on the complete dataset, say Recommendation_System0.
2. Clustering of the customer data will be done and let's say we get 3 clusters namely cluster1, cluster2 and cluster3.  
3. Three different recommendation systems (say) recommendation_System1, recommendation_System2, recommendation_System3 will be applied on cluster1, cluster2 and cluster3 respectively and then their accuracies will be averaged out.
4. Accuracy of Recommendation_system0 will be compared with the above 3 recommendation systems.

[Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce?select=olist_order_items_dataset.csv)
This is a Brazilian ecommerce public dataset of orders made at Olist Store. The dataset has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Dataset consists of 9 different csv files which in turn consists information such as Customer demographics, order details, product info and review etc.
